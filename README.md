## Installation
### Requirements
Needs [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) to render icons correctly.
### AUR
Use your favorite AUR helper or `makepkg` to install.
```sh
paru -S tb.go
```
or
```sh
yay -S tb.go
```
or
```sh
#Manual
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/tb.git
cd tb
makepkg -si
```
### Git
```sh
git clone https://github.com/araaha/tb.go
cd tb.go
make
make sys-install
```
### Binary releases
You can download binaries from here:
* https://github.com/araaha/tb.go/releases

## Usage
### Quickstart
Create a task via `tb task`. You can begin tasks, or complete them. Alternatively `tb note` creates a note. All items are stored in a `taskbook.json` file stored in
* `$XDG_DATA_HOME`
* `$HOME/.local/share/taskbook`

in that order.

Deleting tasks archives them. To permanently remove them, run `tb archive --remove`. `tb clear` clears every completed task and places them in the archive. For further information, run `tb --help` to see all commands. For each subcommand, you can run `--help` for that flag to see examples.

### Shell Completion
* bash
  ```sh
  #Set up completion for tb
  eval "$(tb completion bash)"
  ```
* zsh
  ```sh
  #Set up completion for tb
  source <(tb completion bash)```
* fish
  ```sh
  #Set up completion for tb
  tb completion fish | source
  ```
* powershell
  ```sh
  #Set up completion for tb
  tb completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression```

### Config
The config file is stored in TOML. You can specify one with the `--config` flag. Alternatively, it searches in
* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/taskbook/taskbook.toml`
* `$HOME/.config/taskbook/taskbook.toml`
in that order.

#### Example

```toml
#Gruvbox
[colors]
white = "#ebdbb2"
red = "#fb4934"
yellow = "#fabd2f"
gray = "#928374"
green = "#b8bb26"
blue = "#83a598"
magenta = "#d3869b"
cyan = "#8ec07c"
```

You can specify the colors in hex format.

## Comparison
Compared to [taskbook](https://github.com/klaudiosinani/taskbook):

- **tb.go** respects `$XDG` env
- Shell-completion (via [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra))
- You can specify which colors to use
- Much more performant due to being compiled
- Uses [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) icons

## Thanks to
* [taskbook](https://github.com/klaudiosinani/taskbook) - this project was heavily inspired by this one
